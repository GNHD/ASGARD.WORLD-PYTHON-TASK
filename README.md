Task 1: AWS EC2 Instance Management

Objective: I will be evaluating my proficiency in managing AWS EC2 instances using Python.

Description:

In this task, I will demonstrate my skills as a Python developer by performing the following tasks related to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.

Task Details:

EC2 Instance Creation: I will write a Python script that utilizes the AWS SDK (Boto3) to create a new EC2 instance. My script will include the necessary parameters for specifying the instance type, security group, key pair, and any other relevant configurations.

EC2 Instance Termination: I will develop a Python script that allows for the termination of an existing EC2 instance. I will ensure that I can specify the instance ID as an input to the script.

EC2 Instance Information Retrieval: I will create a Python script that retrieves essential information about EC2 instances in my AWS account. This information will include details such as instance ID, instance type, launch time, and status.

EC2 Instance Tagging: I will write a Python script that enables me to add, modify, or remove tags on EC2 instances. The script will allow me to specify the instance ID and the desired tags.

Task 2: Web Scraping

Objective: I will assess my web scraping skills using Python.

Description:

In this task, I will demonstrate my ability to extract information from websites using Python's web scraping libraries. I will ensure that I adhere to ethical scraping practices and respect the terms of service of the targeted websites.

Task Details:

Website Selection: I will choose a public website (e.g., a news site, e-commerce platform, or any other content-rich site) for web scraping. I will make sure that I have permission to scrape data from this website.

Data Extraction: I will develop a Python script that uses libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape specific data from the chosen website. I will aim to extract structured information, such as headlines, product details, or other relevant content.

Data Storage: I will store the scraped data in a suitable format, such as CSV, JSON, or a database. I will ensure that the data is well-organized and easy to work with for further analysis.

Error Handling: I will implement error handling in my scraping script to gracefully handle issues like connection errors or missing data on the website.
